    "# Xgboost workshop (R version)\n",
    "by Qi XU & Maxime KINET\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to present the use of XGBoost in a practical case and some of the functionalities which makes it so useful. XGBoost is an implementation of a Gradient Boosted decision tree algorithm and is frequently used in winning solutions of data science competitions. XGBoost is an open source library, implemented in C++ with wrappers available in Python and R (among others). We have created two versions of this notebook, one in R and one in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we have chosen to illustrate our purposes comes from the recent B2C competition - Predict conversion rates on breakdown services. The goal was to predict the likelihood of residential customers to subscribe to a maintenance contract. \n",
    "\n",
    "More information on this dataset is available [here](https://datascience-challenge.engie.com/#/challenge/28733).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before we begin...\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to be able to run the notebook, you need to have XGBoost installed on your machine. Installation information is available on the [doc page of XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### R users\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a R user, XGBoost is now available as a CRAN package hence a simple `install.packages('xgboost')` should get you up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from XGBoost, the following libraries are expected to be installed :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ggplot2 (for graphics)\n",
    "2. Ckmeans.1d.dp (for variable importance plots)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python users\n",
    "\n",
    "Python users can use pip to install xgboost *provided* that they are not using windows. On windows, installation can be more complicated and we refer to the documentation for complete instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from xgboost, we expect users to have the following libraries installed :\n",
    "1. pandas (for data frame manipulation)\n",
    "2. numpy (for scientific computing)\n",
    "3. matplotlib (for visualization)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A few words on XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot has been written on XGBoost since its wide adoption by the datascience community. If you want to learn more about it, here are some links where you can start :\n",
